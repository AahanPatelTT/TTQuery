What ADAS does:
- **Detects potential dangers:**
    ADAS systems use sensors and cameras to monitor the vehicle's surroundings, looking for obstacles, other vehicles, pedestrians, and more. 
    
- **Alerts the driver:**
    When a potential hazard is detected, ADAS systems can alert the driver through visual cues, audible warnings, or even steering wheel vibrations. 
    
- **Provides assistance:**
    Some ADAS systems can also take actions to assist the driver, such as automatically braking or steering to avoid a collision. 

Examples of ADAS features:
- **Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC):** Maintains a set speed and distance from the vehicle ahead. 
- **Lane Departure Warning (LDW):** Alerts the driver if the vehicle is unintentionally drifting out of its lane. 
- **Forward Collision Warning (FCW) and Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB):** Alerts the driver of an impending collision and can automatically brake to mitigate or avoid the crash. 
- **Blind Spot Monitoring (BSM):** Alerts the driver of vehicles in their blind spots. 
- **Parking Assistance:** Helps the driver maneuver into parking spaces. 
Benefits of ADAS:
- **Increased safety:**
    ADAS systems can reduce the risk of accidents by helping drivers to detect and react to hazards more quickly. 
- **Reduced driver fatigue:**
    Some ADAS systems can help with tasks like maintaining speed and lane position, reducing driver workload. 
- **More efficient driving:**
    Features like adaptive cruise control can contribute to more fuel-efficient driving. 

ADAS systems are becoming increasingly common in vehicles and are playing a significant role in improving road safety.
