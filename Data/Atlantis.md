- **Robust Security:** Features a hardware security subsystem with AES, SHA, and a TRNG, providing a TrustZone-equivalent solution.
- **High-Speed Connectivity:** Equipped with LPDDR5 memory support, PCIe Gen4 x20, dual USB 3.1, and Gigabit Ethernet.
- **Rich Multimedia Subsystem:** Includes a dedicated GPU, video decoder, and display interfaces like HDMI 2.0 and MIPI DSI.
- **Comprehensive Peripherals:** Offers a full suite of standard interfaces including CAN-FD, I2C, SPI, UART, and GPIO.
- **Advanced Interfaces:** Supports modern standards like the CHI.E coherent interface for high-performance communication.

Atlantis revolutionizes the IP development lifecycle by serving as a definitive pre-silicon software development platform.  Made with the TT-Ascalon RISC-V IP, it breaks the slow, sequential hxardware-first model by enabling your software teams to develop, validate, and optimize a robust software stack in parallel with your core IP design. This concurrent workflow allows you to slash months from your schedule, de-risk system integration, and eliminate the costly delays of waiting for final silicon to begin critical software development.

As a production-intent hardware proxy, Atlantis provides the stable, high-performance foundation needed to build a complete software ecosystem. Your teams can port operating systems, develop drivers for high-speed interfaces like PCIe Gen4 and LPDDR5, and harden security using the hardware-based TrustZone-equivalent subsystem. Furthermore, the rich multimedia and connectivity features allow you to create compelling, real-world customer demos that showcase the true power of your IP in a complete, working system, transforming your sales process from datasheets to demonstrations.

Ultimately, Atlantis is a strategic tool that accelerates your entire business model. By providing a ready-to-use platform to your own teams and your licensees, you empower the entire ecosystem to innovate faster and ensure wider, quicker adoption of your IP. Stop waiting for tape-out and start building your market-leading software solution today. With Atlantis, you can code now for the silicon of tomorrow, securing a decisive competitive advantage.
