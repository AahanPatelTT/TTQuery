**Functional Safety (FuSa)** refers to the property of a system to operate correctly and predictably even when faults occur, ensuring that no unreasonable risk arises from malfunctioning behaviour of electrical/electronic systems. In the context of **Silicon [[Intellectual Property]] (IP)** functional safety is critical for enabling safe operation of complex semiconductor devices, especially in safety-critical applications such as automotive electronics.

> Absence of unreasonable risk due to hazards caused by malfunctioning behaviour

Silicon IP must be designed and verified to meet functional safety requirements so that when integrated into larger systems-on-chip (SoCs), the overall system can be certified safe according to industry standards. Because IP blocks are often developed as **Safety Elements out of Context (SEooC)**—meaning the IP provider does not know the exact usage scenario—the IP must come with detailed safety documentation (a **safety manual**) that outlines assumptions, fault detection and control capabilities, and guidance on safe usage. This documentation supports chip developers in building their own safety cases, which then feed into the safety cases of system integrators and end customers.

Functional safety for Silicon IP involves ensuring predictable failure modes such as graceful degradation or safe shutdowns, fault detection, and mitigation mechanisms. It also requires rigorous development processes and evidence to satisfy independent assessors and certification bodies.

# FuSa Standards for Automotive Applications

The primary standard governing functional safety in automotive electronics is:
## ISO 26262 - Road Vehicles Functional Safety

- **Definition:** ISO 26262 defines functional safety as ***"the absence of unreasonable risk due to hazards caused by malfunctioning behaviour of electrical/electronic systems.**"*  
- **Scope:** It covers the entire lifecycle of automotive electronic systems, from concept through decommissioning, including hardware, software, and system integration.
### Key Points Relevant to Silicon IP and SoCs:

| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Functional Safety (FuSa)**              | Ensures systems operate safely even when faults occur, preventing unreasonable risk.               |
| **Silicon IP Role**                       | Pre-designed blocks must be developed with FuSa principles and provide safety documentation.       |
| **Safety Element out of Context (SEooC)** | IP developed without specific system context, requiring safety manuals to guide safe usage.        |
| **ISO 26262**                             | The key automotive functional safety standard covering the entire lifecycle of electronic systems. |
| **ISO 26262 Part 11**                     | Specific requirements for semiconductor devices and IP under ISO 26262.                            |
| **Safety Cases**                          | Hierarchical documentation from IP to chip to system ensuring traceable safety justification.      |
| **ASIL Levels**                           | Classification of risk levels guiding design rigor and verification efforts                        
#### Detail

- **Part 11 (Semiconductor Devices):**  
  The second edition of ISO 26262 introduced Part 11, which specifically addresses the requirements for semiconductor devices and IP. It adapts the general ISO 26262 requirements to the unique challenges of semiconductor development, including IP design and verification.

- **Safety Element out of Context (SEooC):**  
  Most silicon IP is developed as SEooC, meaning the IP provider supplies a safety manual with assumptions and usage guidelines to enable integration into various systems safely.

- **Safety Case Documentation:**  
  A structured argument supported by evidence that justifies the safety of the IP or chip in its intended environment. This hierarchical safety case flows from IP vendors to chip developers to system integrators.

- **Fault Tolerant Time Interval (FTTI):**  
  ISO 26262 defines the maximum time allowed to detect and mitigate faults before a hazardous event occurs, critical for timing safety mechanisms in IP and SoCs.

- **[[ASIL]] Levels (Automotive Safety Integrity Levels):**  
  Automotive applications are classified from ASIL A (lowest safety requirement) to ASIL D (highest). Silicon IP and SoCs must meet the required ASIL level through design and verification.
