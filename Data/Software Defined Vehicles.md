A Software-Defined Vehicle (SDV) is ==a vehicle where most of its features and functions are managed and enhanced through software, allowing for continuous updates and upgrades throughout its lifespan==. Unlike traditional vehicles, which rely heavily on hardware, SDVs utilize a centralized computing architecture and over-the-air (OTA) updates to add new functionalities, improve performance, and personalize the driving experience.
