 f**Overview of TT-Blackhole**

TT-Blackhole is Tenstorrent’s latest AI accelerator, purpose-built for developers seeking scalable, high-performance solutions for artificial intelligence workloads. Announced at Tenstorrent Developer Day in April 2025, Blackhole is available in several models and is designed to empower developers to build, test, and scale AI applications with unprecedented flexibility and efficiency

**Key Architectural Features**

- **[[RISC-V]] Foundation**: Blackhole leverages a hybrid architecture featuring 16 "Big RISC-V" 64-bit CPU cores capable of running a full Linux environment, complemented by 752 "Baby RISC-V" cores for memory management and data processing. This combination enables Blackhole to function as a standalone AI computer, removing the need for external hosts and simplifying deployment in edge and embedded environments—key for automotive use cases.
    
- **[[TT - Tensix]] Compute Cores**: The chip includes 140 Tensix cores, each optimized for matrix and vector math operations across a range of data types (Int8, TF32, BF/FP16, FP8, and more), supporting the demanding workloads typical in automotive AI, such as perception, sensor fusion, and real-time decision-making.
    
- **High Bandwidth Connectivity**: With 12 lanes of 400G Ethernet, Blackhole is engineered for high-throughput data transfer, crucial for real-time processing of sensor data in autonomous vehicles and advanced driver-assistance systems ([[ADAS]]).
- **Scalability**: Blackhole’s architecture supports multi-chip configurations, allowing developers to scale their solutions from prototyping to full production environments, including data centers and edge deployments.
    

**Developer-Focused Ecosystem**

Tenstorrent has positioned Blackhole as a developer-centric product, offering a suite of tools and resources to accelerate AI application development:

- **Developer Models**: The Blackhole lineup includes models like the p100a, p150a, and p150b, tailored for various performance and budget needs, starting at $999.
    
- **Open-Source and Customization**: Built on RISC-V, Blackhole offers developers the ability to customize and adapt the hardware and software stack for specific automotive requirements, fostering innovation and rapid iteration.
    
- **On-Device Development**: The inclusion of robust on-chip CPUs enables developers to run, debug, and optimize AI workloads directly on the accelerator, streamlining the development process for embedded automotive systems.
