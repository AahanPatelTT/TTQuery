Power - Performance - Area

**Power Metrics:**
- Total power consumption of the processor core, which includes static power (leakage current dependent on core area) and dynamic power (dependent on clock frequency and switching activity).
- Power efficiency under different operating conditions, often measured at specific voltages and frequencies.
- Watts or %Efficiency 
    
**Performance Metrics:**
- Maximum attainable clock frequency of the CPU core, reflecting the highest speed at which the processor can reliably operate.
- Benchmark scores such as CoreMark or **[[DMIPS]]** (Dhrystone MIPS), which provide synthetic performance figures representing the processing throughput or instructions per second. 
- Throughput or latency metrics relevant to the IP’s intended workload or application.

**Area Metrics:**
- Silicon area occupied by the CPU core, typically measured in square milli-meters (**mm²**) in a given semiconductor process technology node.
- Area efficiency metrics such as performance or power per unit area, for example, SPEC PPA (performance per area) scores used to compare CPU cores.
