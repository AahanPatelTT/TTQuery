## Relationships and Competitive Dynamics

- **Vertical Dependence:**  
    Each stage depends on the previous one. For example, chip designers rely on EDA (CAD/IT) and IP, while foundries rely on chip designers for business.
- **Supplier Power:**  
    Some stages (**EDA, IP, Foundry) are highly consolidated**, giving suppliers significant pricing and negotiation power.
- **Customer Lock-in:**  
    Ecosystem and service providers (Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon) create strong lock-in by integrating hardware, software, and services.
- **Co-ompetition:**  
    Many companies are both partners and competitors. For example, Apple is a major TSMC customer but also competes with Samsung in devices.
- **Geopolitical Tension:**  
    The foundry stage is a chokepoint, especially with TSMCâ€™s dominance and US-China tech tensions.
- **Innovation Pressure:**  
    Advanced packaging, AI, and cloud services are current innovation hotspots, with companies racing to differentiate.
