Zero-copy data transfer is ==a technique where data is moved between different parts of a system without the CPU having to copy it from one memory area to another==. Instead, the data stays in its original location, and pointers or references to it are passed around. This approach significantly reduces CPU overhead, minimizes memory bandwidth usage, and leads to substantial performance gains, particularly in applications like network communication and file I/O.
