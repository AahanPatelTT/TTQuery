>Heterogeneous redundancy in autonomous vehicles means using diverse, independent systems to perform the same critical function. This minimizes the risk of a single point of failure, as different systems are unlikely to fail in the same way due to different designs, algorithms, and hardware. This approach enhances safety by providing backup solutions should one system encounter issues.
