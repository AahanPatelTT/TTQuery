 chip design, GDS (Graphic Design System) files, specifically GDSII, are ==the standard format for representing the physical layout of an integrated circuit==.A Binary database file format which is the de facto industry standard for electronic _design_ automation (EDA) data exchange.  They contain the geometric shapes, text, and other information needed to manufacture the chip. These files are the final output of the IC design process and are sent to foundries for fabrication. Typically traded as Hard IP.
